## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains details of car rentals, including:
- **Car Information:** Model, make, and year
- **Rental Pricing:** Daily rental price
- **Fuel Type:** Gasoline, Electric, Hybrid
- **Location Data:** City and regional availability
- **Customer Insights:** Ratings and reviews

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Processing & Analysis:** `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
- **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn` (Regression Analysis)
- **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 🚀 Project Workflow
### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values by removing incomplete rows.
- Ensured proper data types for numerical and categorical variables.
- Removed irrelevant columns such as geolocation data.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Popular Models:** Tesla and Toyota Corolla are the most frequently rented.
- **Price Trends:** Electric vehicles have higher rental prices on average than gasoline or hybrid cars.
- **Regional Demand:** EVs are more popular in metropolitan areas.

### 3️⃣ Regression Analysis
- **Objective:** Examine the relationship between rental price and vehicle year.
- **Model Used:** Simple Linear Regression
- **Formula:** `Rental Price = β0 + β1 * Vehicle Year + ε`
- **Results:**
  - Regression Coefficient: Indicates the impact of vehicle year on rental price.
  - Model Accuracy (R²): Measures how well vehicle year predicts rental price.

### 4️⃣ Recommendations & Real-World Applications
- **Stock Optimization:** Increase electric and hybrid vehicle availability in high-demand regions.
- **Pricing Strategies:** Adjust rental pricing for older vehicle models.
- **Targeted Marketing:** Promote underutilized vehicles through data-driven campaigns.
- **Fleet Management:** Improve operational efficiency by focusing on in-demand vehicle types.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Demand for Electric Vehicles:** EVs have higher rental demand in urban regions.
- **Impact of Vehicle Year:** Newer cars tend to have higher rental prices.
- **Fuel Type & Pricing:** Gasoline cars are generally cheaper, while EVs command premium rental rates.
- **Market Positioning:** Rental companies can align their offerings with eco-friendly and urban rental trends.

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Bar Chart:** Average rental prices by fuel type.
- **Histogram:** Distribution of vehicle years in the dataset.
- **Scatter Plot:** Relationship between rental price and vehicle year.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the critical role of **data analytics in the car rental industry**. By leveraging data-driven insights, rental companies can improve **profitability, enhance customer satisfaction, and stay ahead of market trends**.

## 🔥 Future Enhancements
- Expand the dataset to include additional rental factors like location-based demand trends.
- Apply machine learning models for more advanced pricing predictions.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time market analysis.
